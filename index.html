                            <span class="key-point">An expert doesn't cut corners</span>. They learn the fundamentals. They learn deeply. <b>But how?</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A web development expert needs to know a lot of things. The most fundamental is HTTP, the protocol
                            that carries nearly all HTTP traffic on the web. It's how your browser talks to everything.
                            It's how web sites talk to <i><b>a lot</b></i> of their back-end services. If you're a web
                            programmer, you need to know how it works. The best developers can look at it and see what's going wrong.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you build your own HTTP server, <b>you can stop being "most people" and start being an expert</b>.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">What's Between You and Being an Expert Web Engineer?</h2>

                        <p>
                            A lot of what separates 'just a developer' from 'senior developer' is independence &mdash; the ability to dive deeply into a technical problem and, with exploration, get to the right answer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Nothing teaches you about protocols like building protocols</span>. It's not any more magic than any other coding. It's experience and work. Specifically, it's experience and work in writing and debugging.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Your job isn't going to tell you, "spend a few months becoming an expert in HTTP." And do you
                            already know how? It's a catch-22. How do you get good enough to do it, until you're already
                            good enough to do it?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let's break that deadlock. I'll show you the steps.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've helped thousands of developers become Rails experts by rebuilding a framework like Ruby on Rails.
                            But knowing Rails doesn't teach you everything you need. Sometimes the error is lower down,
                            in the protocol <b><i>under</i></b> the framework. In HTTP.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once you've built the protocol, <span class="key-point">you get a sort of X-ray vision into its problems.</span> You'll find yourself saying, "let me check what the browser is sending &mdash; I think I know what's wrong." You've had that with code you built for yourself. Wouldn't it be great if you had the same thing for HTTP?
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Future-Proof Mastery</h2>

                        <p>
                            You can learn about your framework. You can learn the latest hot thing. And three years later, all the jobs have moved somewhere else. The fads change.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Or you can learn the fundamentals that don't change. HTTP has been around since the mid-90's. It's not going away. Even when it changes, it uses a lot of the same pieces. The pieces that you'll know, once you've built it. You'll be building on top of TCP/IP, which dates back to 1974... These are pieces that are <span class="key-point">not going away</span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            No book can fully prepare you. That takes practice. But Rebuilding HTTP can start you on that practice and show you <span class="key-point">how</span> to practice. Nobody understands protocols and internals like an engineer who has built them. That, dear reader, could be you.

                <h2 class="mb-4">Why You Should Expense Rebuilding HTTP</h2>
                <p>
                    You're a software developer. Your time is expensive. If you don't live in the USA, Rebuilding HTTP still only costs several hours of your salary &mdash; in the United States, it may cost around <a href="https://codefol.io/posts/fully-loaded-engineer-hours/" target="_blank">fifteen minutes of what the business actually pays to keep you</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If Rebuilding HTTP makes you just two percent better at what you do and you stay with your current employer for just two more months, then RH has made a tidy profit for your employer. Each post-Rebuilding-HTTP year you work there (say 50 weeks of work at 40 hours/week) with a two percent improvement will have saved 40 hours of your debugging time to be used on more interesting work, or made you 40 hours more effective at web features. That's worth far more than the price of the book. <span class="key-point">By expensing Rebuilding HTTP and reading it, you're doing your employer a huge favour</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To do them even more of a favour, you could pick up multiple book licenses and share with your coworkers!
